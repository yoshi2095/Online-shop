django-parler
=============

Simple Django model translations without nasty hacks.

Features:

* Nice admin integration.
* Access translated attributes like regular attributes.
* Automatic fallback to the default language.
* Separate table for translated fields, compatible with django-hvad_.
* Plays nice with others, compatible with django-polymorphic_, django-mptt_ and such:

 * No ORM query hacks.
 * Easy to combine with custom Manager or QuerySet classes.
 * Easy to construct the translations model manually when needed.

See the documentation_ for more details.


A brief overview
================

Installing django-parler
------------------------

The package can be installed using::

    pip install django-parler

Add the following settings::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'parler',
    )

Creating models
---------------

Using the ``TranslatedFields`` wrapper, model fields can be marked as translatable::

    from django.db import models
    from parler.models import TranslatableModel, TranslatedFields

    class MyModel(TranslatableModel):
        translations = TranslatedFields(
            title = models.CharField(_("Title"), max_length=200)
        )

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title

Accessing fields
----------------

Translatable fields can be used like regular fields::

    >>> object = MyModel.objects.all()[0]
    >>> object.get_current_language()
    'en'
    >>> object.title
    u'cheese omelet'

    >>> object.set_current_language('fr')       # Only switches
    >>> object.title = "omelette du fromage"    # Translation is created on demand.
    >>> object.save()

Internally, django-parler stores the translated fields in a separate model, with one row per language.

Filtering translations
----------------------

To query translated fields, use the ``.translated()`` method::

    MyObject.objects.translated(title='cheese omelet')

To access objects in both the current and possibly the fallback language, use::

    MyObject.objects.active_translations(title='cheese omelet')

This returns objects in the languages which are considered "active", which are:

* The current language
* The fallback language when ``hide_untranslated=False`` in the ``PARLER_LANGUAGES`` setting.


Changing the language
---------------------

The queryset can be instructed to return objects in a specific language::

    >>> objects = MyModel.objects.language('fr').all()
    >>> objects[0].title
    u'omelette du fromage'

This only sets the language of the object.
By default, the current Django language is used.

Use ``object.get_current_language()`` and ``object.set_current_language()``
to change the language on individual objects.
There is a context manager to do this temporary::

    from parler.utils.context import switch_language

    with switch_language(model, 'fr'):
        print model.title

And a function to query just a specific field::

    model.safe_translation_getter('title', language_code='fr')


Configuration
-------------

By default, the fallback language is the same as ``LANGUAGE_CODE``.
The fallback language can be changed in the settings::

    PARLER_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'


Optionally, the admin tabs can be configured too::

    PARLER_LANGUAGES = {
        None: (
            {'code': 'en',},
            {'code': 'en-us',},
            {'code': 'it',},
            {'code': 'nl',},
        ),
        'default': {
            'fallback': 'en',             # defaults to PARLER_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_CODE
            'hide_untranslated': False,   # the default; let .active_translations() return fallbacks too.
        }
    }

Replace ``None`` with the ``SITE_ID`` when you run a multi-site project with the sites framework.
Each ``SITE_ID`` can be added as additional entry in the dictionary.


Advanced Features
-----------------

This package also includes:

* Creating the ``TranslatedFieldsModel`` manually!
* Form classes for inline support.
* View classes for switching languages, creating/updating translatable objects.
* Template tags for language switching-buttons.
* ORM methods to handle the translated fields.
* Admin inlines support.

See the documentation_ for more details.


Special notes
=============

* Using ``ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields`` doesn't work, but you can use ``get_prepopulated_fields()`` as workaround.
* Due to `ORM restrictions <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#spanning-multi-valued-relationships>`_
  queries for translated fields should be performed in a single ``.translated(..)`` or ``.active_translations(..)`` call.
* The ``.active_translations(..)`` method typically needs to ``.distinct()`` call to avoid duplicate results of the same object.


TODO
====

* The list code currently performs one query per object. This needs to be reduced.
* Preferably, the ``TranslatedField`` proxy on the model should behave like a ``RelatedField``,
  if that would nicely with the ORM too.

Please contribute your improvements or work on these area's!
